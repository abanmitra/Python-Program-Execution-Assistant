### Environment Variables

You can customize the application by modifying the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | The AI model to use for program execution | `ollama/deepseek-r1:14b` |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | URL for the Ollama API | `http://localhost:11434` |
| `OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE` | Temperature setting for the AI model (higher = more creative) | `0.8` |
| `DEFAULT_PROGRAMS_DIRECTORY` | Default directory to search for Python programs | - |

**Reference**: [Custom Ollama Model Creation](https://www.gpu-mart.com/blog/custom-llm-models-with-ollama-modelfile)


### Adding Custom Tools

To extend the application with custom tools:

1. Create a new Python file in the `src/exec_tools` directory.
2. Implement your tool class following the pattern in `CustomTools.py`.
3. Register your tool with the agent in `ProgramExecutionAgents.py`.

Example for a custom tool:

```python
# In a new file, e.g., MyCustomTool.py
from langchain_core.tools import Tool

class MyCustomTool:
    """A custom tool for specific functionality"""
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Implement your functionality here
        return result
        
    def get_tool(self) -> Tool:
        """Create a LangChain Tool instance"""
        return Tool(
            name="my_custom_tool",
            func=self.__call__,
            description="Description of what your tool does"
        )

# Then in ProgramExecutionAgents.py, add:
from src.exec_tools.MyCustomTool import MyCustomTool

# And in the program_execution_agent method:
my_tool = MyCustomTool()
my_langchain_tool = my_tool.get_tool()

# Add to the tools list:
tools=[
    discovery_langchain_tool,
    execution_langchain_tool,
    my_langchain_tool
]
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Directory does not exist or is not valid" error
- Make sure the directory path is correct and accessible.
- Use absolute paths (like `C:/Users/username/projects`) instead of relative paths.

#### 2. "No Python programs with execute() function found" message
- Ensure your Python files have an `execute()` function.
- Check that the files don't have syntax errors.
- Make sure the directory doesn't contain only Python packages or modules.

#### 3. "Program execution failed" error
- Check that all required parameters are provided correctly.
- Look at the error details for specific error messages from your program.
- Make sure your `execute()` function handles exceptions properly.

#### 4. Ollama connection issues
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running (`ollama run deepseek-r1:14b`).
- Check that the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file matches your Ollama installation.
- Verify that the model specified in `OLLAMA_MODEL` is downloaded in Ollama.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the `execute()` function requirement?
The application looks for Python files that contain an `execute()` function. This function should:
- Accept parameters that users will provide through the UI
- Return results that can be displayed in the UI
- Handle exceptions gracefully

#### How do I create a compatible Python program?
Here's a simple example:

```python
# example_program.py

def execute(name="World", times=1):
    """
    A simple greeting program.
    
    Parameters:
    - name (str): Name to greet
    - times (int): Number of times to repeat the greeting
    
    Returns:
    - dict: Greeting results
    """
    try:
        # Convert times to int if it's a string
        times = int(times) if isinstance(times, str) else times
        
        # Create the greeting
        greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
        repeated = [greeting] * times
        
        # Return results
        return {
            "greeting": greeting,
            "repeated": repeated,
            "count": times
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
```

#### Can I use the application with remote APIs?
Yes, you can modify the `.env` file to use OpenAI or other API-based models instead of Ollama. You'll need to update the configuration and potentially modify the agent setup in `ProgramExecutionAgents.py`.
